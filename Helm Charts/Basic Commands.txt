#Adds repo to the helm
helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami 

#Searches the repo 
helm search repo bitnami

#Install chart . Dont forget to update before 
helm repo update              # Make sure we get the latest list of charts
helm install bitnami/mysql --generate-name

Whenever you install a chart, a new release is created. So one chart can be installed multiple times into the same cluster.
And each can be independently managed and upgraded.
===

#To get full information about helm chart use 
helm show all bitnami/mysql

#What has been released
helm list 
helm ls

#To uninstall release
helm uninstall <name>
If the flag --keep-history is provided, release history will be kept. You will be able to request information about that release
Because Helm tracks your releases even after you've uninstalled them, you can audit a cluster's history, and even undelete a release (with helm rollback)
